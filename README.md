# longvinter-modtools
Application to automatically install and handle updates of mods

Doc to come when stable release will be done (selfupdate functionality is broken)

Install the software in : steamapps\Longvinter

First release is done, but there's more to come !
  - Checksum of updates / installations of mods to prevent any corrupted files
  - Auto installation and updates of unrealMods
  - Searchbar to look for available mods based on keywords
  - Protocols to handle modtools://args (Prob could be coupled with a way from servers to automatically download mods)

Mods that uses resources (Like minimap which load maps from .png) needs some extrawork from creator to handle subfolders in CoreMods folder as mods files are contain in mod_name/mod_files.
